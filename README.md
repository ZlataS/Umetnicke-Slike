# GANs-for-paintings

We examined the use of modern Generative Adversarial Networks to generate paintings using the Painter By Numbers dataset. We implemented Deep Convolutional (DC-GAN), Wasserstein (W-GAN) and Spectral Normalization GAN (SN-GAN), and compared their outputs.
Visually, and quantitatively according to the Inception Score, Frechet distance and Sliced Wasserstein Distance metric, we determined
that the SN-GAN produced paintings that were most comparable to our training dataset, the next best was WGAN, and DCGAN scored the lowest.
